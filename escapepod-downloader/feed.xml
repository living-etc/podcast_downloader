<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is a bed, a wardrobe with a large oval mirror, a builtin cupboard to one side of the chimney breast. The boards are bare, stained black. There is a greyish cast to everything. Croft guesses the room has not been used in quite some time.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not much, I’m afraid,” the woman says. Her name is Sandra. Symes has told him everyone including her husband calls her Sandy, but Croft has decided already that he will never do this, that it is ugly, that he likes Sandra better. “I’ve been meaning to paint it, but there hasn’t been time.”</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">She is too thin, he thinks, with scrawny hips and narrow little birdy hands. Her mousy hair, pulled back in a ponytail, has started to come free of its elastic band. Croft cannot help noticing how tired she looks.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t worry,” he says. “If you can let me have the paint, I’ll do it myself.”</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh,” she says. She seems flustered. “I suppose we could take something off the rent money. In exchange, I mean.”</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There’s no need,” Croft says. “I’d like to do it. Something to keep me out of mischief.” He smiles, hoping to give her reassurance, but she takes a step backwards, just a small one, but still a step, and Croft sees he has made a mistake, already, that the word mischief isn’t funny, not from him, not now, not yet.</span></em></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">He will have to be more careful with what he says. He wonders if this is the way things will be for him from now on.</span></em><br />

There is a bed, a wardrobe with a large oval mirror, a builtin cupboard to one side of the chimney breast. The boards are bare, stained black. There is a greyish cast to everything. Croft guesses the room has not been used in quite some time.
“It’s not much, I’m afraid,” the woman says. Her name is Sandra. Symes has told him everyone including her husband calls her Sandy, but Croft has decided already that he will never do this, that it is ugly, that he likes Sandra better. “I’ve been meaning to paint it, but there hasn’t been time.”
She is too thin, he thinks, with scrawny hips and narrow little birdy hands. Her mousy hair, pulled back in a ponytail, has started to come free of its elastic band. Croft cannot help noticing how tired she looks.
“Don’t worry,” he says. “If you can let me have the paint, I’ll do it myself.”
“Oh,” she says. She seems flustered. “I suppose we could take something off the rent money. In exchange, I mean.”
“There’s no need,” Croft says. “I’d like to do it. Something to keep me out of mischief.” He smiles, hoping to give her reassurance, but she takes a step backwards, just a small one, but still a step, and Croft sees he has made a mistake, already, that the word mischief isn’t funny, not from him, not now, not yet.
He will have to be more careful with what he says. He wonders if this is the way things will be for him from now on.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>They walk serene / in spaces between</em></p>
<hr />
All three of these stories are runners up from the PSEUDOPOD flash fiction contest</p>
<hr />
<h3><strong>Zipper</strong> by Murf Freedmont</h3>
<p>Original to Pseudopod. &#8220;Zipper was written entirely on my smart phone (in the middle of the night&#8230;in bed&#8230;when I could not sleep).  I intended it to be a writing prompt for a story to be finished later, but when I counted the words the next morning I decided to submit it to the Pseudopod contest without significant changes.  Since it fared much better than my other submission, perhaps I should limit all my writing to my phone &#8230; but I hate touch screens so much.&#8221;</h3>
<p><strong>MURF FREEDMONT</strong> lives in the Pacific Northwest with his wife and 3 daughters and is an information technologist.</h3>
<p>Your narrator &#8211; Spencer DiSparti -is a published poet and voice actor from Phoenix, Arizona. You can find most of his work at <a href="https://skeletopia.wordpress.com/">SKELETOPIA</a>.</h3>
<p><em>Have you ever tried to open a sleeping bag zipper silently?</em></p>

<h3><strong>Subcutaneous</strong> by <a href="http://www.nicholasconley.com/">Nicholas Conley</a></h3>
<p>This is a PseudoPod Original.</p>
<p>NICHOLAS CONLEY&#8217;s passion for storytelling began at an early age, prompted by a love of science fiction novels, comic books and horror movies. His a science fiction thriller novel <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Pale-Highway-Nicholas-Conley-ebook/dp/B016ALW8PW/">PALE HIGHWAY</a> (available now from Red Adept Publishing) is influenced by his experience working with Alzheimer&#8217;s patients in a nursing home, a subject that he has also written about for publications such as <strong>Vox</strong> and <strong>Alzheimers.net</strong>. PALE HIGHWAY is the story of Gabriel Schist, a genius Nobel Prize winner plagued by Alzheimer&#8217;s, who must find a cure for a terrifying new virus before his mind declines past the point of no return. When not busy writing, Nicholas resides in New Hampshire and spends his time reading, traveling to new places, and indulging in a lifelong coffee habit. To learn more about him, take a stroll over to <a href="http://www.nicholasconley.com/">Nicholas Conley.com</a></h3>
<p>Your narrator &#8211; Rock Manor &#8211; has been a performer featured on The NoSleep Podcast, Chilling Tales For Dark Nights, StarShipSofa, and Tales To Terrify. He is the producer of Manor House: The Podcast, a horror anthology hosted by The Phantom Collector. Best selling author Brian Keene says &#8220;it&#8217;s like Tales From The Crypt. It&#8217;s really fucking cool.&#8221; Manor House: The Podcast is entering it&#8217;s third season which will feature stories by authors such as Adam Cesare and Stoker Award winner Eric J. Guignard.

<h3><strong>The Void</strong> by Thomas Vicinanzo</h3>
<p>Pseudopod original. &#8220;The most terrifying thing is a life devoid of intrinsic meaning, and a universe which does not and cannot understand us.&#8221;</p>

All three of these stories are runners up from the PSEUDOPOD flash fiction contest

Zipper by Murf Freedmont
Original to Pseudopod. &#8220;Zipper was written entirely on my smart phone (in the middle of the night&#8230;in bed&#8230;when I could not sleep).  I intended it to be a writing prompt for a story to be finished later, but when I counted the words the next morning I decided to submit it to the Pseudopod contest without significant changes.  Since it fared much better than my other submission, perhaps I should limit all my writing to my phone &#8230; but I hate touch screens so much.&#8221;
MURF FREEDMONT lives in the Pacific Northwest with his wife and 3 daughters and is an information technologist.
Your narrator &#8211; Spencer DiSparti -is a published poet and voice actor from Phoenix, Arizona. You can find most of his work at SKELETOPIA.
Have you ever tried to open a sleeping bag zipper silently?


Subcutaneous by Nicholas Conley
This is a PseudoPod Original.
NICHOLAS CONLEY&#8217;s passion for storytelling began at an early age, prompted by a love of science fiction novels, comic books and horror movies. His a science fiction thriller novel PALE HIGHWAY (available now from Red Adept Publishing) is influenced by his experience working with Alzheimer&#8217;s patients in a nursing home, a subject that he has also written about for publications such as Vox and Alzheimers.net. PALE HIGHWAY is the story of Gabriel Schist, a genius Nobel Prize winner plagued by Alzheimer&#8217;s, who must find a cure for a terrifying new virus before his mind declines past the point of no return. When not busy writing, Nicholas resides in New Hampshire and spends his time reading, traveling to new places, and indulging in a lifelong coffee habit. To learn more about him, take a stroll over to Nicholas Conley.com
Your narrator &#8211; Rock Manor &#8211; has been a performer featured on The NoSleep Podcast, Chilling Tales For Dark Nights, StarShipSofa, and Tales To Terrify. He is the producer of Manor House: The Podcast, a horror anthology hosted by The Phantom Collector. Best selling author Brian Keene says &#8220;it&#8217;s like Tales From The Crypt. It&#8217;s really fucking cool.&#8221; Manor House: The Podcast is entering it&#8217;s third season which will feature stories by authors such as Adam Cesare and Stoker Award winner Eric J. Guignard. Sign up for Manor House&#8217;s free Fantom Zone membership to receive their monthly newsletter containing exclusives not found anywhere else.

I like the way that skin feels.


The Void by Thomas Vicinanzo
Pseudopod original. &#8220;The most terrifying thing is a life devoid of intrinsic meaning, and a universe which does not and cannot understand us.&#8221;
THOMAS VICINANZO works in Mount Vernon, NY and writes fantasy and horror when he gets the chance. Some day his fantasy novel will be done (not the bad one, the good one), and all his true friends will read it and say it&#8217;s nice.
Your narrator is Laurice White, who last read “Awaiting Redemption” for Pseudopod, part of episode 347 &#8211; Flash On The Borderlands XVI: Trial &#038; Discipline.
I tripped on a little ridge where the turf was bunched up like a carpet. It was early morning and the park was empty, so I pulled at the grass, and it came up, revealing soil blacker than fresh asphalt. Then I saw it wasn’t soil but black empty space.

<p>Before being reprinted in Pseudopod, &#8220;Boys&#8221; was published in 2015 in <strong>The Cadaverine Magazine</strong>, which publishes Prose, Fiction and Nonfiction from writers under thirty. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always struggled with titles, so when submitting work to my creative writing group I had taken to giving my stories temporary headings derived from Latin terms for animals: Ursa (Bear), Haedus (Young Goat), Porcus (Pig). This eventually incurred the wrath of my peers who found it completely pretentious and overblown. Hell hath no fury like writers patronized. Out of sheer stubbornness, I was all set to continue with this practice when submitting my next story, an early draft of this story. &#8220;Bos&#8221; I was intending on titling it, from the Latin term for cow. So I put the word &#8220;Bos&#8221; at the top of the document and as soon as it was there I struggled to take my eyes off it. All my other Latin titles felt like placeholders, but this felt right &#8211; or very nearly right. It was only after an hour or staring that I finally put the vital &#8216;y&#8217; between the &#8216;o&#8217; and the &#8216;s&#8217;, giving myself &#8220;Boys&#8221;. After I got the title right, everything else with the story fell into place in subsequent drafts, thematically, narratively. In naming it I&#8217;d realized something: it wasn&#8217;t the cow, the bos, that gave the story its horror. It was the boys; the foul, abhorrent and distressingly relatable boys.&#8221;</p>

He’s recently been featured in a new zine called <strong>Penny Mag</strong>, which publishes 500-word prose pieces and puts them together with a illustration.

<p>The Eighth Day Brotherhood is a new novel by Alice M. Phillips that should be of interest to PseudoPod listeners. If you want a novel with the milieu of The Stress of Her Regard but tighter pacing, look no further. Couple this with the sensibility of Fincher’s Se7en and you have a tense and relentless thriller. Alice’s love for the tenebrous portions of the Decadent period glows through Paris while the Eiffel Tower rises on the bank of the Seine and as the city prepares of the Exposition Universelle. It manifests with an abiding love for the period supported by an incredible depth of research. Do yourself a favor and pick up this book from Black Rose Writing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blackrosewriting.com/historical-fiction/the-eighth-day-brotherhood">The Eighth Day Brotherhood by Alice M. Phillips — Black Rose Writing</a></p>
<p>One August morning, in Paris, 1888, the sunrise reveals the embellished corpse of a young man suspended between the columns of the Panthéon, resembling a grotesque Icarus and marking the first in a macabre series of murders linked to Paris monuments. In the Latin Quarter, occult scholar Rémy Sauvage is informed of his lover’s gruesome death and embarks upon his own investigation to avenge him by apprehending the cult known as the Eighth Day Brotherhood. At a nearby sanitarium, aspiring artist Claude Fournel becomes enamored with a mesmerist’s beautiful patient, Irish immigrant Margaret Finnegan. Resolved to steal her away from the asylum and obtain her for his muse, Claude only finds them both entwined in the Brotherhood’s apocalyptic plot combining magic, mythology, and murder.</p>

<p><em>It was Ethan’s thirteenth birthday and he had invited me to a sleepover, along with friends from his new school. We were making our way through the forest by his home when he signaled for me to slow down. We allowed the other boys to pull ahead. That’s when he grabbed my arm and uttered a warning in my ear: I wasn’t going to like what he was taking us to see at the river bay.</em></p>

Her right hand was bare of decoration; it hung flaccid by her side, brushing against the soft fur like a sallow slab of flesh. She tried to hide it under her coat. It was defective, shriveled, half paralyzed. </em></p>

<p><em>I stood several yards away in the shade watching her with her friends. We were at an outdoor concert where a local band did a shitty job of playing good songs. Cecilia sat on the grass with those legs sprawled easily in front of her, catching the sun, leaned back and propped on her elbows. She wore a big white floppy hat that should have seemed silly and out of place but instead looked perfect.</em></p>

<p><em>When the bones first began to grow, David had watched them with something like lust. Each night, in his small apartment, he would sit at the edge of his bed and watch the bones shift, gradually taking form. It started with the feet: that multitude of delicate, tiny bones, slowly knitting themselves together.</em></p>
<p><em>It was a secret he kept for himself &#8212; a routine that kept the days in motion, swinging about in silence, with hope.</em></p>

		<itunes:summary>The suffering of strangers, the agony of friends. There is a secret song at the center of the world, and its sound is like razors through flesh.

Hand Off by S. Siporin
This is a Pseudopod Original. “We all have parts of ourselves we are unhappy with; the trick is to accept them as part of who you are”
S. Siporin lives and writes in NYC where strange encounters are commonplace. Other genres include science fiction and romance.
Your narrator &#8211; Louise Ratcliffe is a scientist, artist and stay-home Mum. She lives in New Zealand having moved there from England 12 years ago when her Maori husband brought her home. They have 3 children, 3 cats, 9 chickens, 8 ducks and a goat called Steve. She spends her time creating Art Yarn,  and knitting body parts and blankets. Her work can be seen on Facebook at her Top o&#8217; the Meadow fibre art page, or you can find her on Ravelry as Giggigoofer.








She was wealthy; you could tell by the thick brown fur of her coat, by the elaborate, streaked hair that made her look ten years younger than she really was. Three slender fingers on her left hand gleamed smooth and ivory; they were heavy with silver and gold rings, mementoes of failed marriages. Her right hand was bare of decoration; it hung flaccid by her side, brushing against the soft fur like a sallow slab of flesh. She tried to hide it under her coat. It was defective, shriveled, half paralyzed. 
Without warning, it twitched, the fingers diddling as if playing an invisible piano, as if restless, discontent. The line between her eyes deepened, darkened as if someone had drawn on her face with magic marker. Not again, she thought. Not here. Her left hand pressed its palm flat against her forehead; she felt the ache of an incipient migraine. 











Hide by Annie Neugebauer 
“Hide” was first published in Black Static Issue 43 by TTA Press in November 2014.
Annie Neugebauer is a returning visitor to Pseudopod Towers. She last visited with &#8220;Jack and the Bad Man&#8221; for Halloween 2014. Annie Neugebauer is a novelist, short story author, and award-winning poet. She has work appearing in over fifty venues, including  Fireside, Buzzy Mag, and DarkFuse. She’s an active member of the Horror Writers Association, the webmaster for the Poetry Society of Texas, and a columnist for Writer Unboxed. She lives in Texas with her sweet husband and two diabolical cats.
Your narrators &#8211; Marc Bailey and Heather Welliver have been a part of the podcasting community since 2006 as voice actors and narrators. They are in the process of rebooting their podcast Grailwolf&#8217;s Geek Life with a new name, focused on positive reviews of all things geeky along with thoughtful essays on the continuing The Geek Renaissance. 
When I met Cecilia I’d only been dead for twenty years and she’d only been alive for about as many. She was all golden-brown skin and mahogany eyes and legs that stretched longer than the last week of summer, and I was cold – so cold.
I stood several yards away in the shade watching her with her friends. We were at an outdoor concert where a local band did a shitty job of playing good songs. Cecilia sat on the grass with those legs sprawled easily in front of her, catching the sun, leaned back and propped on her elbows. She wore a big white floppy hat that should have seemed silly and out of place but instead looked perfect.


Think of the Bones by Gary Emmette Chandler 
This is a PseudoPod Original. It is about struggling with body image, and whether the story&#8217;s resolution is comforting or unsettling is up to the listener. Recommended additional reading is &#8220;The Skeleton&#8221; by Ray Bradbury, which is included in the October Country collection. 
Your Author &#8211; Gary Emmette Chandler works from his apartment in Portland as a copywriter and web developer, mostly in pajamas, with a cat nibbling at his leg. His fiction has appeared in Daily Science Fiction, Pantheon, and Fantasy Scroll, among others. Yo[...]</itunes:summary>

<p>The Eighth Day Brotherhood is a new novel by Alice M. Phillips that should be of interest to PseudoPod listeners. If you want a novel with the milieu of The Stress of Her Regard but tighter pacing, look no further. Couple this with the sensibility of Fincher’s Se7en and you have a tense and relentless thriller. Alice’s love for the tenebrous portions of the Decadent period glows through Paris while the Eiffel Tower rises on the bank of the Seine and as the city prepares of the Exposition Universelle. It manifests with an abiding love for the period supported by an incredible depth of research. Do yourself a favor and pick up this book from Black Rose Writing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.blackrosewriting.com/historical-fiction/the-eighth-day-brotherhood">The Eighth Day Brotherhood by Alice M. Phillips — Black Rose Writing</a></p>

In the Latin Quarter, occult scholar Rémy Sauvage is informed of his lover’s gruesome death and embarks upon his own investigation to avenge him by apprehending the cult known as the Eighth Day Brotherhood. At a nearby sanitarium, aspiring artist Claude Fournel becomes enamored with a mesmerist’s beautiful patient, Irish immigrant Margaret Finnegan.

One, the pitching mound is a lonely place, not only because the pitcher is separated from the rest of the team, but also because he dictates the pace of the game. There&#8217;s a very real sense of isolation and pressure. Two, the catcher is both field general and psychologist to the pitcher. He calls the game (suggests which pitches to throw), and when the pitcher gets into trouble, the catcher goes to the mound to calm him down. As such, the relationship between pitchers and catchers is often quite strong. The pair are often called the &#8220;battery,&#8221; a word with appropriate military connotations, as the pitcher and catcher form a strategic plan throughout an at bat to get the hitter out.&#8221;  </p>

<p><em>Randall Simmons only plays night games. As he steps into the right-handed box and taps his bat on the plate, he reminds me why. His smile, aimed directly at the pitcher’s mound, is wide and predatory. The bright stadium lights catch for a moment on his teeth, and even from 60 feet, 6 inches away, I see those teeth are too long and too sharp.</em></p>

If you want a novel with the milieu of The Stress of Her Regard but tighter pacing, look no further. Couple this with the sensibility of Fincher’s Se7en and you have a tense and relentless thriller. Alice’s love for the tenebrous portions of the Decadent period glows through Paris while the Eiffel Tower rises on the bank of the Seine and as the city prepares of the Exposition Universelle. It manifests with an abiding love for the period supported by an incredible depth of research. Do yourself a favor and pick up this book from Black Rose Writing.
The Eighth Day Brotherhood by Alice M. Phillips — Black Rose Writing
One August morning, in Paris, 1888, the sunrise reveals the embellished corpse of a young man suspended between the columns of the Panthéon, resembling a grotesque Icarus and marking the first in a macabre series of murders linked to Paris monuments. In the Latin Quarter, occult scholar Rémy Sauvage is informed of his lover’s gruesome death and embarks upon his own investigation to avenge him by apprehending the cult known as the Eighth Day Brotherhood. At a nearby sanitarium, aspiring artist Claude Fournel becomes enamored with a mesmerist’s beautiful patient, Irish immigrant Margaret Finnegan. Resolved to steal her away from the asylum and obtain her for his muse, Claude only finds them both entwined in the Brotherhood’s apocalyptic plot combining magic, mythology, and murder.

Randall Simmons only plays night games. As he steps into the right-handed box and taps his bat on the plate, he reminds me why. His smile, aimed directly at the pitcher’s mound, is wide and predatory. The bright stadium lights catch for a moment on his teeth, and even from 60 feet, 6 inches away, I see those teeth are too long and too sharp.</itunes:summary>

<p>&#8220;There Is No Road through the Woods&#8221; is a Pseudopod Original. &#8220;Silly as it seems — no, is — I&#8217;m actually a bit afraid of plants. I like trees, and I have a garden, but there&#8217;s something unnerving about being among all these living things that we treat as though they&#8217;re just background. They&#8217;re alive. It freaks me out. The title of this story comes from a Rudyard Kipling poem, <em>The Way Through The Woods</em>. I read this poem when I was about three quarters of the way finished with the piece, and it really shaped the way it turned out.</p>
<p><strong>The Way Through The Woods</strong><br />
by <strong>Rudyard Kipling</strong></p>
<p>They shut the road through the woods<br />
Seventy years ago.<br />
Weather and rain have undone it again,<br />
And now you would never know<br />
There was once a road through the woods<br />
Before they planted the trees.<br />
It is underneath the coppice and heath,<br />
And the thin anemones.<br />
Only the keeper sees<br />
That, where the ring-dove broods,<br />
And the badgers roll at ease,<br />
There was once a road through the woods.<br />
Yet, if you enter the woods<br />
Of a summer evening late,<br />
When the night-air cools on the trout-ringed pools<br />
Where the otter whistles his mate,<br />
(They fear not men in the woods,<br />
Because they see so few.)<br />
You will hear the beat of a horse&#8217;s feet,<br />
And the swish of a skirt in the dew,<br />
Steadily cantering through<br />
The misty solitudes,<br />
As though they perfectly knew<br />
The old lost road through the woods.<br />
But there is no road through the woods.</p>

The Way Through The Woods
by Rudyard Kipling
They shut the road through the woods
Seventy years ago.
Weather and rain have undone it again,
And now you would never know
There was once a road through the woods
Before they planted the trees.
It is underneath the coppice and heath,
And the thin anemones.
Only the keeper sees
That, where the ring-dove broods,
And the badgers roll at ease,
There was once a road through the woods.
Yet, if you enter the woods
Of a summer evening late,
When the night-air cools on the trout-ringed pools
Where the otter whistles his mate,
(They fear not men in the woods,
Because they see so few.)
You will hear the beat of a horse&#8217;s feet,
And the swish of a skirt in the dew,
Steadily cantering through
The misty solitudes,
As though they perfectly knew
The old lost road through the woods.
But there is no road through the woods.

<p>****************************</p>
<p><em>MY MOTHER WAS A FISH. That’s why I can swim so well, according to my father, who is a plain fisherman with a fisherman’s plain logic, but uncanny flair for the dramatic. And while it’s true that I can cut through the water like a minnow, or a hand dipped over the edge of a speedboat, I personally think it’s because no one can grow up along the Mekong without learning two things: how to swim, and how to avoid the mermaids.</em></p>
<p><em>Mermaids, like my father’s favorite storytale version of my mother, are fish. They aren’t people. They are stupid like fish, they eat your garbage like fish, they sell on the open market like fish. Keep your kids out of the water, keep your trash locked up, and if they come close to land, scream a lot and bang pots together until they startle away. They’re pretty basic.</em></p>
<p><em>My sisters tried to talk to a mermaid once. It was caught up in one of Dad’s trammel nets, and when they went to check the net out back behind the house, they found this mermaid tangled in it. It was a freshwater one, a bottom-feeder, with long, sparse hair whose color my sisters still argue about to this day. Iris, the oldest, felt bad for it and made May splash some water on its fluttery gills with her red plastic pail. She asked the mermaid if it was okay, what its name was. But it just stared at her with its stupid sideways fish eyes, mouth gaping open and closed with mud trickling out over its whiskers. Then Dad came home and yelled at Iris and May for bringing in the nets too early and touching the mermaid, which probably had sea lice and all kinds of other diseases.</em></p>

<h1>Artemis Rising 3 : Return of Hecate</h1>
<p><b>Artemis Rising</b> returns in March 2017 across all four Escape Artists podcasts! Celebrating its third anniversary, Artemis Rising will be a month-long showcase of stories by women and nonbinary authors in speculative fiction.</p>
<p>PseudoPod is seeking reprint or original (preferred) horror fiction with a length of 2000 – 6000 words and will be open for Artemis Rising submissions during the month of September 2016. Anyone who identifies as a woman, to whatever degree they do, and non-binary authors are welcome and encouraged to submit a story.</p>
<p>Payment, rights, and manuscript format will be the same as specified in our general guidelines, but Artemis Rising will have a dedicated submissions portal.</p>
<p>As always, Escape Artists strongly encourages submissions from people of backgrounds that have been historically underrepresented or excluded from traditional horror, including, but not limited to, people of color, LGBTQ authors, persons with disabilities, members of religious minorities, and people from outside the United States. Our goal is to publish fiction that reflects the diversity of humankind, so we strongly encourage submissions from these or any other underrepresented groups.</p>
<div class="entry">
<p>The PseudoPod Artemis Rising submissions portal will open on September 1, 2016. We look forward to reading your stories!</p>

<p>by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_E._Howard"><strong>Robert E. Howard</strong></a></p>
<p>&#8220;The Horror From The Mound&#8221; was first published in <strong>WEIRD TALES</strong>, May 1932.</p>
<p>Most famous for inventing the modern sword &#038; sorcery tale with his Conan stories, <strong>ROBERT E. HOWARD (1906-1936)</strong> often introduced horror elements as a threat in his short fiction but the evocation of supernatural dread is only incidental in most of his tales; the chronicling of titanic adventure is the primary purpose. When Howard later switched from fantasy to westerns, he made the transition with this story. Howard&#8217;s major horror genre reputation rests with three stories (sadly, all of which are a bit too long for the podcast): &#8220;Black Canaan&#8221; (<strong>Weird Tales</strong>, 1936) was praised by Lovecraft for its &#8220;genuine, regional background and its compelling picture of the horror that stalks through the moss-hung, shadow-cursed, serpent-ridden swamps of the American far south&#8221;; &#8220;Pigeons from Hell&#8221; (<strong>Weird Tales</strong>, 1938) was praised by Stephen King as &#8220;one of the finest horror stories of our century&#8221; and &#8220;Worms of the Earth&#8221; (<strong>Weird Tales</strong>, 1932) is thought by many Howard fans to be his best story. The Del Rey series of Howard&#8217;s collected fiction includes Horror, Historical Adventures and Desert Adventures, in addition to his better known Conan, Kull and Solomon Kane tales. Please see <a href="http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/authors/52853/robert-e-howard/"><strong>this site</strong></a>. More info on Howard can be found at <a href="http://www.rehfoundation.org/"><strong>the REH Foundation</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.crossplainstx.com/howard/museum.htm"><strong>Project Pride</strong></a>, the caretakers of the REH House and Museum in Cross Plains, TX.</p>
<p>Your reader &#8211; <strong>Anson Mount</strong> &#8211; should need no introduction, but just in case we hope you&#8217;ve been watching him on AMC&#8217;s <strong>HELL ON WHEELS</strong>. He was last heard on Pseudopod in the Artemis Rising episode <a href="http://pseudopod.org/2015/02/27/pseudopod-427-artemis-rising-women-in-horror-showcase-carnation-lily-rose/"><strong>Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose</strong></a> by Kelly Link.</p>
<p>Anson&#8217;s audio producer is the impeccable Branan Edgans (whom you last heard reading on Pseudopod in <a href="http://pseudopod.org/2015/04/04/pseudopod-432-the-influence-of-thomas-glittio/"><strong>The Influence Of Thomas Glittio</strong></a>.

&#8220;The Horror From The Mound&#8221; was first published in WEIRD TALES, May 1932.
Most famous for inventing the modern sword &#038; sorcery tale with his Conan stories, ROBERT E. HOWARD (1906-1936) often introduced horror elements as a threat in his short fiction but the evocation of supernatural dread is only incidental in most of his tales; the chronicling of titanic adventure is the primary purpose. When Howard later switched from fantasy to westerns, he made the transition with this story. Howard&#8217;s major horror genre reputation rests with three stories (sadly, all of which are a bit too long for the podcast): &#8220;Black Canaan&#8221; (Weird Tales, 1936) was praised by Lovecraft for its &#8220;genuine, regional background and its compelling picture of the horror that stalks through the moss-hung, shadow-cursed, serpent-ridden swamps of the American far south&#8221;; &#8220;Pigeons from Hell&#8221; (Weird Tales, 1938) was praised by Stephen King as &#8220;one of the finest horror stories of our century&#8221; and &#8220;Worms of the Earth&#8221; (Weird Tales, 1932) is thought by many Howard fans to be his best story. The Del Rey series of Howard&#8217;s collected fiction includes Horror, Historical Adventures and Desert Adventures, in addition to his better known Conan, Kull and Solomon Kane tales. Please see this site. More info on Howard can be found at the REH Foundation and Project Pride, the caretakers of the REH House and Museum in Cross Plains, TX.
Your reader &#8211; Anson Mount &#8211; should need no introduction, but just in case we hope you&#8217;ve been watching him on AMC&#8217;s HELL ON WHEELS. He was last heard on Pseudopod in the Artemis Rising episode Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose by Kelly Link.
Anson&#8217;s audio producer is the impeccable Branan Edgans (whom you last heard reading on Pseudopod in The Influence Of Thomas Glittio. Dan Powell is a podcast producer, audio engineer and sound designer. He is one half of Dead Signals, the production team between found-footage horror podcast Archive 81 and their more recent sci-fi adventure story, The Deep Vault. He can be tweeted @stereophobe.
And we would also like to thank Chris and Rob at BrickShop Audio in Industry City, Brooklyn for the recording help!

<p><em>‘This thing’s hard on my arse.’ Albert fidgeted on the rungs. After a few hours they cut into your buttocks and forced you to change position. At least, that was the effect they had on Albert. He noticed that many of the others never seemed to move at all.</em></p>

<p><strong>FRITZ REUTER LEIBER JR.</strong> (1910-1992) was an American writer of fantasy, horror, and science fiction. He was also a poet, actor in theater and films, playwright and chess expert. With writers such as Robert E. Howard and Michael Moorcock, Leiber can be regarded as one of the fathers of sword and sorcery fantasy, having in fact created the term. Leiber was heavily influenced by H. P. Lovecraft and Robert Graves in the first two decades of his career. Beginning in the late 1950s, he was increasingly influenced by the works of Carl Jung, particularly by the concepts of the anima and the shadow. From the mid-1960s onwards, he began incorporating elements of Joseph Campbell&#8217;s <strong>THE HERO WITH A THOUSAND FACES</strong> into his work.  </p>

<p>&#8220;The Tooth Fairy&#8221; is a PseudoPod Original. &#8220;I hope the story works on its own without needing to know too much. But I&#8217;ve always been fascinated by the fascination that people have with serial killers, and how our perception is affected by both the fiction and the mythologizing of fact. To say much more would of course be to give away some of the story. Its also an unusual piece for me in that its one of very few  stories I&#8217;ve written set in the US. I&#8217;ve always wanted to write more US based fiction as that is mostly what I read, although I&#8217;m known for writing about Scotland and, more generally, the city of Dundee. It was refreshing to be able to write about a subject matter and location that was new to me, and the enthusiasm of Pseudopod for the story has been a great reward for taking that risk.&#8221;</p>

&#8220;The Tooth Fairy&#8221; is a PseudoPod Original. &#8220;I hope the story works on its own without needing to know too much. But I&#8217;ve always been fascinated by the fascination that people have with serial killers, and how our perception is affected by both the fiction and the mythologizing of fact. To say much more would of course be to give away some of the story. Its also an unusual piece for me in that its one of very few  stories I&#8217;ve written set in the US. I&#8217;ve always wanted to write more US based fiction as that is mostly what I read, although I&#8217;m known for writing about Scotland and, more generally, the city of Dundee. It was refreshing to be able to write about a subject matter and location that was new to me, and the enthusiasm of Pseudopod for the story has been a great reward for taking that risk.&#8221;

<p><em>There’s a killer in my kitchen. I don’t know how long he’s been here, sitting in the dark. I didn’t notice him until I was already six steps inside, obliviously hitting the light and grabbing a pear from the basket by the stove. He’s sitting at the little wooden table I keep by the window. He looks like he’s waiting for dinner. His elbows hang over the edge and his hands rest on top of each other. One hand clenches the handle of a machete. The tool sports a fresh, gleaming edge. It was sharpened with obvious care. It&#8217;s wet and glistening in the fluorescent light.</p>
<p>He’s massive, so unbelievably *big*. He’s a heavy chunk of muscle and bone, tied off in a mechanic’s jumpsuit. Clumps of drying mud peel from his boots. </p>

<p>by <a href="http://samjmiller.com/"><strong>Sam J. Miller</strong></a></p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing is Truly Yours&#8221; is a PseudoPod Original. &#8220;This story is an homage to the work of Julio Cortazar, a brilliant amazing writer who wrote horror, fantasy, science fiction that a lot of genre readers miss because people think of &#8220;magical realism&#8221; as lit-fic with ghosts, instead of a unique Latin American evolution of all that is wonderful about SF/F/H. He also translated the complete stories of Edgar Allan Poe into Spanish, and those translations are magnificent. So if folks like this story they should seek him out &#8211; &#8220;House Taken Over&#8221; is the spiritual antecedent to this story, but &#8220;Axolotl&#8221; &#038; &#8220;We Love Glenda So Much&#8221; and &#8220;Blow Up&#8221; and &#8220;The Southern Highway&#8221; and tons of his other stories, and his novel &#8220;Hopscotch&#8221; are all genius. And if you  DON&#8217;T like this story, you should still seek him out, because it just means I horribly botched my homage.&#8221; </p>
<p><strong>SAM J. MILLER</strong> is a writer and a community organizer. His fiction is in <strong>Lightspeed</strong>, <strong>Asimov’s</strong>, <strong>Clarkesworld</strong>, and <strong>The Minnesota Review</strong>, among others.

He lives in New York City, and at <a href="http://samjmiller.com/"><strong>Sam J. Miller</strong></a> where you can find a whole bunch of his stories.</p>

<p>****************************</p>
<p><em>&#8220;It started in the room you call your studio, the spare bedroom at the end of the hall, where you keep the tools of your creative trade, the room you swear you&#8217;ll start making better use of—just as soon as this work project or upcoming event is over, or your brother&#8217;s current life crisis settles down. It started late at night, in the long dark dead hours of the morning when the call of the toilet summons you from sleep, and you stagger to the bathroom in a haze of fury and fear, terrified you’ll never fall back to sleep, convinced that here, now, is the beginning of the end, of your brain and your body conspiring to finally kill you. It started in the instant after you flushed, in the space of white noise where the ear is especially sensitive to possibly-imagined sounds. What was this one: a breath sucked in? A cough stifled? No. Nothing so concrete. But a house feels different when you are not alone. Sound echoes distinctly in an empty apartment. You had felt this before. Vague blurry feelings, indistinct impressions when drunk or depressed, knowledge that came from somewhere other than reason or the senses. Adrenaline unspooled in your abdomen. Tiny hairs along your neck and arms quivered, then stood up straight.</p>
<p>And in that moment you knew: someone was in there. Someone was in your home, sitting at the cluttered desk of your studio, silently, perfectly still but not asleep, in darkness, eyes open, looking in your direction. And you stood at the door—put your fingers against the cold firm real non-nightmare wood—and turned and hurried back to bed.&#8221;</em></p>

&#8220;Nothing is Truly Yours&#8221; is a PseudoPod Original. &#8220;This story is an homage to the work of Julio Cortazar, a brilliant amazing writer who wrote horror, fantasy, science fiction that a lot of genre readers miss because people think of &#8220;magical realism&#8221; as lit-fic with ghosts, instead of a unique Latin American evolution of all that is wonderful about SF/F/H. He also translated the complete stories of Edgar Allan Poe into Spanish, and those translations are magnificent. So if folks like this story they should seek him out &#8211; &#8220;House Taken Over&#8221; is the spiritual antecedent to this story, but &#8220;Axolotl&#8221; &#038; &#8220;We Love Glenda So Much&#8221; and &#8220;Blow Up&#8221; and &#8220;The Southern Highway&#8221; and tons of his other stories, and his novel &#8220;Hopscotch&#8221; are all genius. And if you  DON&#8217;T like this story, you should still seek him out, because it just means I horribly botched my homage.&#8221; 
SAM J. MILLER is a writer and a community organizer. His fiction is in Lightspeed, Asimov’s, Clarkesworld, and The Minnesota Review, among others. He is a nominee for the Nebula and Theodore Sturgeon Awards, a winner of the Shirley Jackson Award, and a graduate of the Clarion Writer’s Workshop. His debut dark, edgy, fucked-up young adult science fiction novel THE ART OF STARVING is forthcoming from HarperCollins. He lives in New York City, and at Sam J. Miller where you can find a whole bunch of his stories.

She never had a pet rabbit, but she did have a hamster named Chucky Cheeks who wanted to be an astronaut. Karen is the Nonfiction Assistant Editor for Mothership Zeta, Escape Artists’ new e-zine and has been having a spectacular time helping set up the first issue.

<p>“Out through that window, three years ago to a day, her husband and her two young brothers went off for their day&#8217;s shooting. They never came back. In crossing the moor to their favourite snipe-shooting ground they were all three engulfed in a treacherous piece of bog. It had been that dreadful wet summer, you know, and places that were safe in other years gave way suddenly without warning. Their bodies were never recovered. That was the dreadful part of it.&#8221; &#8211; Saki</p>

<p><strong>JOE L. HENSLEY (1926 – 2007)</strong> was a lawyer, prosecuting attorney, member of the Indiana General Assembly, circuit court judge, science fiction fan, and writer of science fiction and mysteries. While working as a law student, lawyer, legislator and judge, Hensley wrote science fiction and crime fiction (and at least one auto-racing story for a pulp magazine) as Joe L. Hensley and Louis J. A. Adams. His first fiction sale was the short story &#8220;And Not Quite Human,&#8221; published in the September 1953 issue of <strong>Beyond Fantasy Fiction</strong>. His first published novel was <strong>The Color of Hate</strong> in 1960. He had 20 more novels and collections published (over half of them in the series featuring Indiana circuit judge Donald Robak, which began with 1971&#8217;s <strong>Deliver Us to Evil</strong>) and around 100 short stories. His collaborators in science fiction included Alexei Panshin and Harlan Ellison; he co-wrote one mystery novel (<strong>Loose Coins</strong>) with fellow Indiana prosecuting attorney Guy M. Townsend. His last novel, <strong>Snowbird&#8217;s Blood</strong>, was published in February 2008. Many of his mystery novels were set in the fictitious Bington, a place which combined aspects of Madison and Bloomington. Hensley remained active in science fiction fandom throughout his life; the Hensleys were familiar faces at science fiction conventions such as Rivercon and Midwestcon. Hensley was a First Fandom &#8220;Dinosaur&#8221; (which meant he had been active in fandom prior to July 4, 1939), and received the First Fandom Hall of Fame Award in 2006.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Voyage &#038; The Ship&#8221; originally appeared in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Flesh-Sutra-Tim-W-Burke/dp/0991500113?ie=UTF8&#038;*Version*=1&#038;*entries*=0"><strong>THE FLESH SUTRA</strong></a>.</p>
<p><strong>TIM W. BURKE</strong> grew up a mile from the most notorious prisons in the U.S.  He produced movies found on Netflix and wrote comedy sketches about the brains of the Kennedy Brothers playing touch football. Currently, he finds horror to be more emotionally satisfying. His novel &#8220;The Flesh Sutra&#8221; earned a place on the preliminary ballot for the 2015 Stoker Awards. Read his advice and inspirations at <a href="https://timwburke.com/"><strong>timwburke.com</strong></a>.</p>
<p>In THE FLESH SUTRA body horror and mysticism entwine under gaslight. We find ourselves in Fin de siècle Boston, where the mystic healer Alecsandri Keresh falls into the desperate embrace of his lover, Mrs. Olivia Spaulding, only to be shot dead in her arms. Alecsandri&#8217;s rage at her husband’s murderous action transforms his power and he returns to life &#8211; as an abomination. Recognizing each other as soul mates, Olivia and Alecsandri resolve to atone for their sins by helping humanity. But their jealousies mar their works &#8211; often with hideous results. And, to further warp their efforts, a vengeful spirit stalks them. One that grows more powerful at every turn. Will the depraved lovers succeed? Or will they mutilate mankind for love? Alasdair Stuart and Shawn Garrett agree and THE FLESH SUTRA earned its way to the preliminary ballot of the 2015 Stoker Awards</p>

&#8220;The Voyage &#038; The Ship&#8221; originally appeared in THE FLESH SUTRA.
TIM W. BURKE grew up a mile from the most notorious prisons in the U.S.  He produced movies found on Netflix and wrote comedy sketches about the brains of the Kennedy Brothers playing touch football. Currently, he finds horror to be more emotionally satisfying. His novel &#8220;The Flesh Sutra&#8221; earned a place on the preliminary ballot for the 2015 Stoker Awards. Read his advice and inspirations at timwburke.com.
In THE FLESH SUTRA body horror and mysticism entwine under gaslight. We find ourselves in Fin de siècle Boston, where the mystic healer Alecsandri Keresh falls into the desperate embrace of his lover, Mrs. Olivia Spaulding, only to be shot dead in her arms. Alecsandri&#8217;s rage at her husband’s murderous action transforms his power and he returns to life &#8211; as an abomination. Recognizing each other as soul mates, Olivia and Alecsandri resolve to atone for their sins by helping humanity. But their jealousies mar their works &#8211; often with hideous results. And, to further warp their efforts, a vengeful spirit stalks them. One that grows more powerful at every turn. Will the depraved lovers succeed? Or will they mutilate mankind for love? Alasdair Stuart and Shawn Garrett agree and THE FLESH SUTRA earned its way to the preliminary ballot of the 2015 Stoker Awards

It has been translated into Chinese, French, and German. &#8220;The Fisher Queen&#8221; is set up in the fashion of traditional oral storytelling, where truth and myth blend together. However, it&#8217;s about the very real effects of societal, systematic violence against women.</p>

<p>****************************</p>
<p><em>MY MOTHER WAS A FISH. That’s why I can swim so well, according to my father, who is a plain fisherman with a fisherman’s plain logic, but uncanny flair for the dramatic. And while it’s true that I can cut through the water like a minnow, or a hand dipped over the edge of a speedboat, I personally think it’s because no one can grow up along the Mekong without learning two things: how to swim, and how to avoid the mermaids.</p>
<p>Mermaids, like my father’s favorite storytale version of my mother, are fish. They aren’t people. They are stupid like fish, they eat your garbage like fish, they sell on the open market like fish. Keep your kids out of the water, keep your trash locked up, and if they come close to land, scream a lot and bang pots together until they startle away. They’re pretty basic.</p>
<p>My sisters tried to talk to a mermaid once. It was caught up in one of Dad’s trammel nets, and when they went to check the net out back behind the house, they found this mermaid tangled in it. It was a freshwater one, a bottom-feeder, with long, sparse hair whose color my sisters still argue about to this day. Iris, the oldest, felt bad for it and made May splash some water on its fluttery gills with her red plastic pail. She asked the mermaid if it was okay, what its name was. But it just stared at her with its stupid sideways fish eyes, mouth gaping open and closed with mud trickling out over its whiskers. Then Dad came home and yelled at Iris and May for bringing in the nets too early and touching the mermaid, which probably had sea lice and all kinds of other diseases.</em></p>

My sisters tried to talk to a mermaid once. It was caught up in one of Dad’s trammel nets, and when they went to check the net out back behind the house, they found this mermaid tangled in it. It was a freshwater one, a bottom-feeder, with long, sparse hair whose color my sisters still argue about to this day. Iris, the oldest, felt bad for it and made May splash some water on its fluttery gills with her red plastic pail. She asked the mermaid if it was okay, what its name was. But it just stared at her with its stupid sideways fish eyes, mouth gaping open and closed with mud trickling out over its whiskers. Then Dad came home and yelled at Iris and May for bringing in the nets too early and touching the mermaid, which probably had sea lice and all kinds of other diseases.</itunes:summary>

<p>Pseudopod would like to draw your attention to a fantastic announcement this week, the <a href="http://www.eugiefoster.com/eugieaward">Eugie Foster Memorial Award for Short Fiction</a>. The Eugie Award will celebrate the best in innovative fiction. This annual award will be presented for the first time in 2016—for works published in 2015—at Dragon Con, the nation’s largest fan-run convention.</p>
<p>The Eugie Award honors stories that are irreplaceable, that inspire, enlighten, and entertain. It will shine the spotlight stories that are beautiful, thoughtful, and passionate. That change us and the field. The recipient will be a story that is unique and will become essential to speculative fiction readers. We look forward to seeing the list of finalists, which will be announced in the not too distant future.</p>
<p>This award reflects what Eugie gave to us. She was inspiring, enlightening, and entertaining. Words fail to convey how much she meant to us as a creator and as a human.</p>
<p>To remember how irreplaceable Eugie is to us all, we are re-running episode 428, &#8220;When It Ends, He Catches Her&#8221; which includes the Escape Artists memoriam at the end. It was a Nebula finalist along with this week’s story, “The Fisher Queen” by Alyssa Wong. For those of you who are new to the podcast, this is an essential part of the back catalog not to be missed. For those of you who have stuck around these parts, I encourage you to give it another listen.</p>
<p>We look forward to celebrating Eugie and other authors and their unforgettable stories through this new award.</p>

<p>****************************</p>
<p>&#8220;The dim shadows were kinder to the theater&#8217;s dilapidation. A single candle to aid the dirty sheen of the moon through the rent beams of the ancient roof, easier to overlook the worn and warped floorboards, the tattered curtains, the mildew-ridden walls. Easier as well to overlook the dingy skirt with its hem all ragged, once purest white and fine, and her shoes, almost fallen to pieces, the toes cracked and painstakingly re-wrapped with hoarded strips of linen. Once, not long ago, Aisa wouldn&#8217;t have given this place a first glance, would never have deigned to be seen here in this most ruinous of venues. But times changed. Everything changed.</p>
<p>Aisa pirouetted on one long leg, arms circling her body like gently folded wings. Her muscles gathered and uncoiled in a graceful leap, suspending her in the air with limbs outflung, until gravity summoned her back down. The stained, wooden boards creaked beneath her, but she didn&#8217;t hear them. She heard only the music in her head, the familiar stanzas from countless rehearsals and performances of <i>Snowbird&#8217;s Lament</i>. She could hum the complex orchestral score by rote, just as she knew every step by heart.</p>

It was supposed to be a duet, her as Makira, the warlord&#8217;s cursed daughter, and Balege as Ono, her doomed lover, in a frenzied last dance of tragedy undone, hope restored, rebirth. But when the Magistrate had closed down the last theaters, Balege had disappeared in the resultant riots and protests.&#8221;</div>
